Your program should:

Ask the user for their starting and ending towns, making sure theyâ€™re both towns in the database.
Ask them then to select the search method they wish to use to find a route to the destination.
    If that route exists, the program should then print the route the method found in order, from origin to destination.
    If you want to get fancy, you might see how the route generated looks as a map (either a map of connected states as we looked at in class, or as a projection in 2D space based on location and connectivity).
    
    Note that your database is very limited, and many of the real-world roads are left out for simplicity*.

Your program should also: 
    measure and print the total time needed to find the route (and include a time-out).
    calculate and display the total distance (node to node) for the cities visited on the route selected.
    (opt) determine the total memory used (scale of the arrays) to find the solution.

Return to the search method selection and allow a new method to be selected for comparison. 

Submission: Your submission will include:
1) A link to the repo -- Replit, GitHub, Jupiter or GitLab (or zip file of your project from your IDE) 
2) A video demonstrating and explaining both the CODE and the requested FUNCTIONALITY. 
You should accomplish this demonstration by selecting a set of start and end points that show off the operation of your code. [Suggestions on candidate search pairs will be provided later]
Please include a discussion of your observations of the difference in execution time for each method.
You should SPEAK while showing the code, be sure to highlight how each of your functions are finding the route.
This video should be 3-5 minutes in length [you can/should edit out those boring segments of the runtime] -- please do not exceed 7 minutes for your video.
